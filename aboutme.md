### Hello, I'm Victor.

I'm a scientist, with great interest in finding innovative ways to unlock the biology from big data. In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, soccer and playing drums (most of them almost reduced to zero after becoming a father last year). Following my PhD degree in Chile (2009), I co-founded an innovation consulting firm, with focus on biotechnology businesses. Even though it was a successful enterprise (which is still running), I switched back to my passion: science. That, combined with the idea of exploring new horizons, moved me to Vancouver, Canada in 2011. 
I love challenges, so I decided to refocus my research - how genomic alterations drive tumor development- taking advantage of the development of new DNA/RNA sequencing technologies and the amazing amount of information that you can get from it. While hard at the beginning (I had to start from scratch with my computer skills), it's been an incredibly amusing journey to build a powerful and resourceful team that has been highly productive and thriving even with all the challenges. Currently, I'm having a great time leading different projects involving small RNAs, environmental factors linked to cancer and tumor biology. Next, I'm looking forward to translating the findings of my research into benefits for cancer patients, and general population exposed to environmental carcinogens. Always happy to grow my network, so contact me at vmartinez@bccrc.ca
